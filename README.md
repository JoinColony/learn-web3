# Learn web3 with Colony

Learn Web3 with Colony! Resources and application source code

‚ÄúLearn web3 with Colony" is a free, twitch-based online course designed for anyone interested in learning the fundamentals of web3 frontend development and DAO application programming. We‚Äôll do regular low-key streaming sessions where we learn and build together! This course is targeted to web2 developers who‚Äôd like to get their feet wet in the web3 world.

## Past episodes

## Requirements

You‚Äôll need a basic understanding of JavaScript and React fundamentals to be able to follow along.

## What we‚Äôll learn

We‚Äôll start with the foundations of smart contract interactions using ethers.js. We'll show you how to execute transactions, query information, and query contract events from a chain. We then go on to make a sample application that can create a connection to the user‚Äôs MetaMask wallet and initiate transactions.

Then we‚Äôll look at the Colony Network and go over the basic concepts and moving parts that make up this DAO framework. We‚Äôll explore Colony SDK, the developer kit that makes it easy to use Colony‚Äôs main functions and infrastructure.

## What we‚Äôll build

This is the most exciting part! We're going to build a full-stack web application based on Next.js and Colony SDK. This application will provide a ‚ÄúMissions Dashboard‚Äù for every DAO on the Colony Network in which tasks can be listed that the DAO needs to get done. Each task can be associated with a bounty denominated in the DAOs main currency or other coins.

Here are the main features that we want to implement:

- List all colony missions
- Users can apply for missions, the DAO can accept or decline
- Users can be paid manually, once a mission was completed

And you know what? *You* can help building it, too! It‚Äôll be out in the open on GitHub from day one! We‚Äôll create issues that can be worked on between sessions and coordinate in Discord. If you want to be an active part of the development, join the [#buidl-with-colony channel in our Discord](https://discord.gg/5wKkCHDY)! There will be some bounties in CLNY out there for sure!

## (Preliminary) Schedule

Each session will be recorded and published to the Colony YouTube channel, so you don‚Äôt have to worry about missing one. I‚Äôll be updating this agenda as the course progresses as I‚Äôm certain that we won‚Äôt be able to stick to it 100%. See this as a rough skeleton.
