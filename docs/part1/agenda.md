# Part 1 agenda

## Housekeeping

### What's this course about
 - Learning how to read and talk to Smart Contracts in general
 - Use of web3 libraries like ethers.js
 - Building a web application that talks to Smart Contracts
 - Also: this a _streaming_ course, so no shortcuts, only the brutal reality

### What is it not
 - We won't explain:
   - How the Ethereum blockchain works
   - How to write Smart Contracts in Solidity
   - How to deploy Smart Contracts
 - Complete or comprehensive (nor a fast track to becoming a web3 developer)

## Today
- A first look at a Smart Contract (ERC20 Token)
  - What about state?
  - Calls and transactions
  - Events
- What's Ethereum JSON-RPC and how does it work
- Calling contract functions from JavaScript
- Big numbers
- ABIs
