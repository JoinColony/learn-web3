# Where to go from here?

## Issues to fix

- Colony SDK doesn't seem to work properly so I'll have to look into this

## Potential points of improvement

- Improve admin checks for pages (currently take a long time) - idea: store admin rights in database, then check in API calls, adjust if necessary
- Proper Navbar that shows whether a user is logged in or not (and doesn't just have a [COLONY LOGO] placeholder)
- Add token symbol to missions (and create mission screen)
- Redirect user after forms were submitted successfully
- Autoconnect
- Better typing (e.g. type all the session objects like `siwe`)
- Better tooling (add prettier and eslint rules)
